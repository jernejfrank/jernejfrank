## Hello there 👋

I’m Jernej and besides finishing my PhD in quantum optics I build ML systems.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about parameter estimation theory for optical metrology and building a statistical boundaries simulation app (link to repo coming soon after I get the draft on arXiv)
- 🔭 I enjoy contributing to open-source projects: currently core contributor for [Hamilton](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/) and [Burr](https://burr.dagworks.io). I also wrote a [cool blog post](https://blog.dagworks.io/p/deep-dive-on-hamilton-decorators) about an interesting way [Hamilton](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/) uses Python decorators.

Happy to chat and solve problems together. Just shoot me an [email](contact@jfrank.co.uk)
