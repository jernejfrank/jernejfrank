## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jernej and besides finishing my PhD in quantum optics I build ML systems.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about parameter estimation theory for optical metrology.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building a statistical boundaries simulation app (coming soon).
- ðŸ”¥ I enjoy contributing to open-source projects: core contributor for [Hamilton](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/) and [Burr](https://burr.dagworks.io). I also wrote a [cool blog post](https://blog.dagworks.io/p/deep-dive-on-hamilton-decorators) about an interesting way [Hamilton](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/) uses Python decorators.

Happy to chat and solve problems together. The easiest way to get in touch is via [email](mailto:contact@jfrank.co.uk).
